# plotting_examples

The included Jupyter notebook gives additional examples of making basic plots needed to work on upcoming exercises.  

Exercise 1:
- Complete cells at the bottom of the notebook and include your updated notebook in your repo.

The most convenient way to work on the notebook on Rivanna is to spin up a Jupyterlab session after making a local clone of your repository.  Make sure to select the Phys56xx kernel.

Exercise 2: 

This repo also contains basic examples of using ROOT in your C++ or Python programs to generate plots.  To build the C++ program, first make sure you are in the phys56xx environment, then type ```make```.  This will create a program called cpp_example. Run the program with ```./cpp_program```.  The equivalent Python example can be run using ```python python_example.py```. 

The C++ example is more advanced.  This is provided as a first example of one way to incorporate graphing in a compiled C++ program.  The ```Makefile``` contains the necessary definitions to build the program.  These definitions include the location of header files so the compiler can check that the ROOT classes are being used properly and the location of the shared libraries so the linker can utilize the precompiled code in your program.  You will not be responsible for writing Makefiles from scratch in this class, examples will be provided as needed.  Run and observe the output of this code.

- Write a python program ```myplots.py``` that uses Matplotlib/numpy, etc. to generate the plots shown in the C++ example (canvas1_py.png, canvas2_py.pdf) .  Push these to your repo.

Exercise 3 (PHYS5630 only):

- Modify both the C++ and Python examples as follows 
  - Turn each of the Gaussian distributions into a 2D Gaussian with the same $\mu, \sigma$ in each dimension as in the original example
  - Similarly include 2D versions of the background distributions
  - For the C++ version, include a second build definition to in the Makefile to build the cpp_example2.cpp program.
  - For the Python version you may use either ROOT or Matplotlib, etc.
  - Output the following 2 files, one from each program: ```canvas2d_py.png``` and ```canvas2d_cpp.png```, and include these in your repo.  In this case you only need to save the second plot containing 4 panels.

(Use program names: ```cpp_example2.cpp``` , ```python_example2.py``` and push these to your github repo)




-----------------------------------

Exercise 1 – Discussion
The notebook shows plotting of sin(x) and cos(x) over a specified domain. Separate panels were used to clearly show each function, with labels, legends, and grid lines for clarity. This exercise reinforces plotting multiple functions, customizing figures, and working interactively in JupyterLab.

Exercise 2 – Discussion
The C++ example uses ROOT to generate Gaussian histograms and modified distributions (uniform offset, 1/x² baseline, double Gaussian). The Python program replicates these plots using Matplotlib. This exercise shows how the same distributions can be visualized in both languages, highlighting plotting options and consistent visualization of statistical data.

Exercise 3 – Discussion
The 1D distributions were extended to 2D with the same mean and standard deviation per axis. Backgrounds were also extended to 2D, and a double Gaussian was included. Python uses hist2d with color maps and optional log scaling; C++ uses ROOT’s TH2F and COLZ options. These 2D plots show correlations and density distributions, demonstrating multi-panel visualization of complex statistical data.
